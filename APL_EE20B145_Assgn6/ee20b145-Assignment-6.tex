\section{Time response of a spring}
In this assignment we are about to find output of given function in the s-domain using impulse response of given function.
Consider the forced oscillatory system given by the equation:$x(0)=0,\dot x(0)=0$
\begin{equation}
    \ddot x + 2.25x = f(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    f(t) = cos(1.5t)e^{-0.5t}*u(t)
\end{equation}
whose laplace transform is
\begin{equation}
    F(s) = (s+0.5)/((s+0.5)^2+2.25)
\end{equation}
Solving for $X(s)$ in Laplace domain we get,
\begin{equation}
    X(s) = \frac{s+0.5}{((s+0.5)^2+2.25))(s^2+2.25)}
\end{equation}

\section{Time response of a spring using transfer function}
Obtain system transfer function $X(s)/F(s)$ for above $x(t),f(t)$. And vary $\omega$ from 1.4 to 1.6 with 0.05 gapping in $f(t)$.Use $signal.lsim$ and find resulting responses and plot them.
From the given equation, we can see that the natural response of the system has the frequency w = 1.5 rad/s . Thus, as expected the maximum amplitude of oscillation is obtained when the frequency of $f(t)$ is 1.5 rad/s, due to resonance.

\section{Coupled spring problem}
We now consider a coupled Differential system
\begin{equation}
    \ddot x + (x-y) = 0
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    \ddot y + 2(y-x) = 0
\end{equation}
with the initial conditions: $\dot x(0) =0,\dot y(0) =0,x(0) =1,y(0) =0$.
Taking Laplace Transform and solving for $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$, We get:
\begin{equation}
    X(s) = \frac{s^2+2}{s^3 + 3s}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    Y(s) = \frac{2}{s^3 + 3s}
\end{equation}
And with time being constrained between 0 and 20 we need to plot both $x(t),y(t)$ with respect to time.

\section{Two-port Network}
We need to obtain Magnitude and phase response of the steady state transfer function of given 2 port network.
The Steady-State transfer function of the given circuit is given by
\begin{equation}
    H(s) = \frac{10^6}{s^2/10^6 + 100s + 10^6}
\end{equation}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Phase.png}  
    \caption{Phase response} 
    \label{fig:fig6}
  \end{figure}
\section{Low pass filter response}
Low pass filter is given by below equation:\newline
\begin{center}
$V_i(t) = (cos(10^3t) - cos(10^6t))u(t)$
\end{center}
we need to find output for $0<t<30\mu s$ and $0<t<10ms$ using $signal.lsim$ nd then plot it w.r.t input.
we can find all by using $t,y,svec=sp.lsim(H,u,t)$ where y is output, u is input, H is transfer function of given 2 port network.

\section{Conclusion}
    The scipy.signal library provides a useful toolkit of functions for circuit analysis. The toolkit was used for the analysis of LTI systems in various domains.\\
    The forced response of a simple spring body system was obtained over various frequencies of the applied force, and highest amplitude was observed at resonant frequency.\\
    A coupled spring problem was solved using the sp.impulse function to obtain two sinusoids of the same frequency.\\
    A two-port network, functioning as a low-pass filter was analysed and the output was obtained for a mixed frequency input.
